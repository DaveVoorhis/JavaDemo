This example keeps the Person and PersonPicker classes from the previous example, but introduces
a Sale class that references Person.

Assume the requirement is for PersonPicker to pick from a list of Person instances where the
Person's total sales are greater than 20 or the Person's age < 18, and the Person instances
must be sorted by name.
