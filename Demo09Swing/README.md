Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for Java.

It's one of the first widget toolkits to be fully and automatically responsive -- it adapts
to display resolutions, window sizes, etc., without explicit resize handling code. This is
done by layout managers, which both simplify and complicate window layout...

There are various layout managers. The one used here is a 3rd-party layout manager
called MigLayout.

Note that there are no event handlers defined here, so the buttons do nothing.
